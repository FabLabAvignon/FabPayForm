This project is for automating FabLab's membership with FabManager API.

# Features

  - Provides secure PayPal payment, with Credit Card or PayPal account.

# Requirements
  - A web server, with PHP(Currently tested with 7.0).
  - A Buissness or Pro PayPal account, as we use PayPal API(s) to protect payments.
  - An SMTP server with user/password connection (Can be a standard email provider(Gmail supports it) or a domain email) to send mails to member/FabLab.
  - A MySQL(or MariaDB :D) database to store member information before payment and apply them after(We doesn't wanted to send member's datas to PayPal).
  - A FabManager, with his API key.
  - A little bit of time to configure :D
